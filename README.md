# MapStruct Service Demo

This project is a **Spring Boot 3** application (Java 17) that demonstrates how to use **MapStruct** together with **Lombok** to map between `Entity` and `DTO` objects.  
It also provides a simple **in-memory repository**, **service layer**, **REST API**, and **JUnit tests**.
